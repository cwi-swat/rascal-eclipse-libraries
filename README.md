This project bundles a number of Eclipse feature projects and an Eclipse update site for
a selected set of Rascal libraries. The goal is to make these libraries readily available
in Eclipse. They all depend on the rascal-eclipse project which is delivered through another
update site.

The libraries are in different states of development, as are their licenses. The license of
these meta-data projects is all BSD..
